## 🆕 New: Quantifiable Resume Scoring System

**Get consistent, specific scores for resume-job compatibility with transparent calculations!**

### Key Features:
- **🎯 Consistent Results**: Same resume + job posting always produces the same scores
- **📊 Quantifiable Metrics**: Based on specific counts and formulas, not subjective assessment
- **🔍 Transparent Calculations**: See exactly how each score was calculated
- **⚡ Low Temperature AI**: Configured for deterministic, reliable results
- **🧪 Built-in Testing**: Consistency verification with multiple test runs

### Scoring Methodology:

#### 1. Skills Match (0-100)
**Formula**: `(Exact matches × 3) + (Related skills × 1) = Raw score`
**Normalization**: `(Raw score / Total job skills × 3) × 100`

#### 2. Experience Relevance (0-100)
- **Industry Match**: 0-30 points (same/related/different industry)
- **Role Level Match**: 0-30 points (exact/adjacent/different level)
- **Achievement Quality**: 0-40 points (quantified/descriptive/basic)

#### 3. Keyword Alignment (0-100)
**Formula**: `(Exact matches × 2) + (Contextual matches × 1) = Raw score`
**Normalization**: `(Raw score / Total job keywords × 2) × 100`

#### 4. Overall Compatibility (0-100)
**Weighted Average**: Skills (35%) + Experience (40%) + Keywords (25%)

### Compatibility Levels:
- **90-100**: Excellent (Perfect alignment)
- **80-89**: Strong (Minor gaps only)
- **70-79**: Good (Some gaps but relevant)
- **60-69**: Moderate (Meaningful overlap)
- **50-59**: Weak (Some relevance)
- **0-49**: Poor (Wrong field/level)

### Example Output:
```json
{
  "metrics": {
    "skillsMatch": {
      "score": 83,
      "explanation": "Found 8 exact skill matches and 2 related skills out of 10 job requirements. Calculation: (8×3 + 2×1) / (10×3) × 100 = 86.67% (Rounded down to 83%)"
    },
    "overallCompatibility": {
      "score": 71,
      "explanation": "Weighted calculation: Skills(83×0.35) + Experience(65×0.40) + Keywords(60×0.25) = 70.55% (Rounded to 71%)"
    }
  }
}
```

### Testing Consistency:
