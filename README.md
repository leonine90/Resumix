## How to Modify Your Resume

### 1. Personal Information
Edit the `personal` object in `data/resume.js`:

```javascript
personal: {
  name: "Your Name",
  title: "Your Title",
  address: "Your Address",
  dateOfBirth: "YYYY/MM/DD",
  phone: "Your Phone",
  email: "your.email@example.com",
  linkedin: "https://linkedin.com/in/your-profile",
  linkedinText: "/your-profile",
  headshot: "https://example.com/your-headshot.jpg" // URL to your headshot image
}
```

### 2. Section Visibility
Control which sections appear on your resume:

```javascript
sections: {
  summary: false,
  researchInterests: true,
  education: true,
  experience: true,
  publications: true,
  skills: true,
  volunteering: true,
  languages: true,
  signature: true
}
```

### 3. Research Interests
The research interests section supports multiple versions. Each version is an array of objects with `title` and `description`:

```javascript
researchInterests: {
  "web-version": [
    {
      title: "Your Research Interest",
      description: "Description of your research interest..."
    }
  ],
  "data-version": [
    // Data science focused interests
  ],
  "v-3": [
    // Research & academia focused interests
  ],
  "ai-version": [
    // AI & business focused interests
  ]
}
```

### 4. Education
Add or modify education entries in the `education` array:

```javascript
education: [
  {
    institution: "University Name",
    location: "City, Country",
    degree: "Degree Name",
    period: "Year - Year",
    coursework: ["Course 1", "Course 2"], // Optional
    finalProject: {                        // Optional
      title: "Project Title",
      objective: "Project objective...",
      keyTopics: "Key topics covered...",
      outcome: "Project outcome..."
    },
    gpa: "GPA/Scale",                      // Optional
    description: "Description..."          // Optional
  }
]
```

### 5. Experience
Modify work experience in the `experience` array:

```javascript
experience: [
  {
    company: "Company Name",
    location: "City, Country",
    position: "Job Title",
    period: "Month Year - Month Year",
    achievements: [
      "Achievement 1",
      "Achievement 2"
    ]
  }
]
```

### 6. Publications
Update publications in the `publications` array:

```javascript
publications: [
  {
    title: "Publication Title",
    url: "https://link-to-publication.com",
    description: "Brief description of the publication..."
  }
]
```

### 7. Skills
Modify the skills list:

```javascript
skills: [
  "Skill 1",
  "Skill 2",
  "Skill 3"
]
```

### 8. Languages
Add language skills:

```javascript
languages: [
  "English (Fluent)",
  "Spanish (Intermediate)",
  "French (Basic)"
]
```

### 9. Volunteering
Update volunteer experience:

```javascript
volunteering: [
  {
    organization: "Organization Name",
    location: "City, Country",
    role: "Your Role",
    period: "Year - Year",
    description: "Description of your involvement..."
  }
]
```

### 10. Signature
Customize the signature section:

```javascript
signature: {
  name: "Your Name",
  date: "Current Date"
}
```

## Using the Interface

### Sidebar Controls
- **Collapsible Sidebar**: Toggle the sidebar on the left to access all controls
- **Header Elements**: Checkboxes to show/hide header elements (address, phone, email, LinkedIn, headshot)
- **Resume Sections**: Checkboxes to show/hide sections and arrows to reorder them
- **Data Management**: Import/export resume data as JSON
- **Version Selector**: Switch between different resume versions in the top-right

### Inline Editing with Rich Text Formatting

#### ðŸŽ¨ Floating Toolbar
When editing is enabled, a Notion-like floating toolbar provides rich text formatting options:

1. **Enable Editing**: Set `editable: true` in `data/resume.js`
2. **Click any editable text** to activate the editing mode
3. **Floating toolbar appears** above the clicked element with formatting options
4. **Apply formatting** using toolbar buttons or keyboard shortcuts
5. **Click outside** to save changes and hide the toolbar

#### âœ¨ Available Formatting Options

**Text Formatting:**
- **Bold** (Ctrl+B / Cmd+B) - Make text bold
- **Italic** (Ctrl+I / Cmd+I) - Make text italic

**Lists:**
- **Bullet List** - Convert text to bulleted lists
- **Numbered List** - Convert text to numbered lists

**Links:**
- **Insert Link** - Create hyperlinks to external resources
  - Select text and click link button to make it clickable
  - Click without selection to insert URL as both text and link
  - Links open in new tabs for better user experience

**Utilities:**
- **Remove Format** - Clear all formatting from selected text

#### ðŸŽ¯ How It Works

1. **Smart Detection**: Toolbar only appears for elements with the `.editable` class
2. **Click-Based Activation**: Toolbar shows when you click on editable text (not just selection)
3. **Auto-Positioning**: Toolbar positions itself above the clicked element, staying within viewport
4. **Non-Intrusive**: Toolbar disappears when clicking outside or on non-editable areas
5. **Print-Safe**: Toolbar is automatically hidden when printing

#### ðŸ’¡ Usage Tips

- **Hover Effects**: Blue highlight on hover shows which elements are editable
- **Focus Indicators**: Blue outline appears when editing an element
- **Persistent Formatting**: All formatting is preserved when you save changes
- **Cross-Component**: Works across all resume sections (Summary, Experience, Education, etc.)

#### ðŸ”§ Technical Details

- Built with Vue 3 composables for optimal performance
- Uses native `document.execCommand` for reliable formatting
- Integrates seamlessly with existing blur handlers for data persistence
- SSR-compatible with proper client-side hydration

### Download PDF
1. **Click the "Download PDF" button** in the top-right
2. The controls will temporarily disappear
3. Use your browser's print dialog to save as PDF
4. Controls will reappear after printing

## Switching Between Versions

> **Note:** Make sure `enableVersions` is set to `true` in `data/resume.js` to display the version selector dropdown. When this flag is `false`, the app defaults to the "web-version" and only the **Download PDF** button is visible.

The resume supports multiple versions that can be switched using the version selector in the top-right corner:

- **Web Development**: Focused on web technologies and front-end development
- **Data Science**: Emphasizes data analysis, machine learning, and big data
- **Research & Academia**: Highlights research interests and academic achievements
- **AI & Business**: Focuses on AI, business intelligence, and digital transformation

## Adding Your Headshot

1. **Enable Headshot**: In the sidebar, expand "Header Elements" and check the "Headshot" checkbox
2. **Paste URL**: In the **Headshot URL** input field, paste the link to your profile image (local uploads are not supported)
3. **Supported URLs**: Any publicly accessible image URL (JPG, PNG, WebP, etc.)
4. **Recommended**: Use a square image (120x120 pixels or larger) for best results
5. **Examples**: LinkedIn profile photo, GitHub avatar, or any hosted image URL

## Importing and Exporting Resume Data

### Exporting
- Open the sidebar (left panel) and expand the **Data Management** section.
- Click **Export as JSON** to download your current resume data as a JSON file.
- The exported file includes all sections, personal info, header elements, section order, and visibility settings.

### Importing
- Open the sidebar and expand the **Data Management** section.
- Click **Import from JSON** to open the import modal.
- Paste your JSON data into the text area provided.
- Click **Import Data**. Your resume will update with the imported data, merging with the current structure.

## Sidebar Controls

- **Header Elements**: Toggle the visibility of header elements (e.g., address, phone, email, LinkedIn, headshot) using checkboxes. Name and Title are always visible.
- **Resume Sections**: Show/hide entire sections (Summary, Research Interests, Education, etc.) and reorder them using the up/down arrows.
- **Data Management**: Import/export your resume data as JSON for easy backup, sharing, or migration.
